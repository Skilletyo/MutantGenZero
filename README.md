# MutantGenZero
Generates random zones for the TTRPG Mutant: Year Zero.

Short and sweet little script I wrote on day one of trying to learn Python.
All this does is to spit out some different names of enviroments and so on stored in variables.
Also does some virtual dicerolling when it comes to the "difficulty"
Originally scripted to be all in one file, but I lost my patience and separated them.

Will probably revisit this once I've learned more and add some features
Things I'd like to add are as follow:

An actual GUI with some nice blurred out post-apocalyptic pictures
The ability for the user to input their own text
Better threat generation
