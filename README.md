# MutantGenZero
Generates random zones for the TTRPG Mutant: Year Zero.

Short and sweet little script I wrote on day one of trying to learn Python.
All this does is to spit out some different names of environments and such that are stored in variables.
Also does some virtual dicerolling when it comes to the "Difficulty"
Originally scripted to be all in one file, but I lost my patience and separated them.

Will probably revisit this once I've learned more and add some features, things I'd like to add are as follow:

An actual GUI with some nice blurred out post-apocalyptic background pictures, the ability for the user to input their own text and better threat generation.
